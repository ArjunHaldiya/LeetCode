# Arjun’s LeetCode Journey
---

## Overview

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions Repository** — a personal log of every problem I solve on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).  
This repository automatically syncs my submissions through the **LeetSync Chrome Extension**, allowing me to track my progress and growth in one place.  

I’m solving problems by category, following the order on the LeetCode website.  
Each submission represents one step toward mastering **data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving patterns**.

---

## Approach

Each solution follows a consistent process:

1. Understand the problem and restate it clearly.  
2. Plan an appropriate algorithm or data structure.  
3. Implement a clean, efficient Python solution.  
4. Optimize the code for time and space complexity.  
5. Reflect on the key concepts and patterns learned.

## Workflow

- Problems are solved directly in the **LeetCode editor**.  
- Solutions are automatically **pushed to this repository using [LeetSync](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leetsync)**.  
- Each commit includes:
  - The problem title and number  
  - My Python solution  
  - Optional comments explaining the reasoning or optimizations  

This setup provides a clean and chronological record of my problem-solving progress.

---

## Goals

- Strengthen understanding of core data structures and algorithms  
- Improve analytical and logical thinking  
- Build confidence for technical interviews  
- Maintain consistent practice and long-term growth tracking  

---

## Notes

Each solution reflects an effort to understand concepts deeply rather than memorize patterns.  
Over time, this repository will serve as both a **study resource** and a **record of progress** in algorithmic problem-solving.
